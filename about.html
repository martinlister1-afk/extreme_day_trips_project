        <h1>Extreme Day Trip</h1>
        <p>
          At Extreme Day Trips, we believe adventure shouldn't wait for annual leave, 
          perfect timing, or a week-long holiday. We're here for the travellers who want 
          more — more intensity, more experiences, more stories — all packed into a single, 
          unforgettable day.
        </p>
        <p>
          We specialise in crafting high‑impact, high‑efficiency adventures designed to 
          squeeze every drop of excitement out of 24 hours. No hotels. No wasted time. 
          Just pure, concentrated exploration. From sunrise in one country to sunset in 
          another, from spontaneous city-hopping to adrenaline-fuelled challenges, we 
          show what's possible when you refuse to settle for ordinary.

        <h2>What Is an Extreme Day Trip?</h2>
        <p>
          An extreme day trip is travel without limits. It's the art of squeezing a full 
          adventure into a single day — crossing borders, chasing experiences, and doing 
          more in 12–24 hours than most people manage in a weekend. These trips are fast, 
          bold, and unapologetically ambitious. Whether it's sunrise in one country and 
          sunset in another, or a whirlwind loop of food, culture, and adrenaline, an 
          extreme day trip is about proving what's possible when you refuse to waste a minute.
